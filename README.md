A FizzBuzz implementation with design patterns

## FizzBuzz

The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:

For numbers 1 through 100,

* if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;
* if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;
* if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;
* else, print the number.
